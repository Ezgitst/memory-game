# memory-game

A memory game that works on web.

The project has 3 files; _index.html_ , _app.css_ and _app.js_ .

You do not need to install any additional libraries or packages to run the program. All you need to have is the source files and a web 
browser. You can immediately start playing the game by opening the _index.html_ file.

Just after you made your first click, the timer starts and the program holds the elapsed time. Also, the program hold the count of the every
move that you made during the game and it dynamically gives you a star rating based on your performance (the ratio of move count over the 
elapsed time.)
